# Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

## Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

## Solution

### Reconnaissance
There are now multiple files in the inhere directory, all of them seem to be human-readable when running ls -h. Want to find a way to list files with text inside of it, or maybe the amount of space using in the file, no luck.

### Commands Used
```
ls,cd,
```

### Explanation
Listing all the files worked, although it might have been an efficient method

## What I Learned
- learned a bit about how the du command works, but it wasn't useful as all the files had commonalities
